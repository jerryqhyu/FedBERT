[CLS] the covid-19 contraction futures is unprecedented in modern times for its severity and speed . [SEP] following the [MASK] plunge since the great depression , employment [MASK] activity rebounded faster and more sharply than anticipated . [SEP] but [MASK] recent resurgence in [MASK] cases is a [MASK] reminder that the pandemic remains the key [MASK] of the economy's course . [SEP] a thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us , and downside risks predominate . [SEP] the recovery is likely to face headwinds even if the downside [MASK] do not materialize , and a second wave would magnify that challenge . [SEP] fiscal support will remain vital . [SEP] looking ahead , [MASK] likely will be [MASK] to shift the focus [MASK] monetary policy from [MASK] to accommodation by supporting a full recovery in [MASK] and a sustained return [MASK] inflation to its 2 percent objective.1

[CLS] a variety of [MASK] suggest [MASK] economy bottomed out in april and rebounded in may and june . [SEP] [MASK] employment rebounded strongly in may and june . [SEP] retail sales jumped 18 percent in may , [MASK] market expectations , and real personal consumption expenditures [MASK] ) [MASK] estimated to have increased 8 percent . [SEP] consumer sentiment improved in may and june.2 and both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing institute for supply management indexes jumped [MASK] expansionary territory [MASK] month . [SEP] financing conditions remain broadly accommodative [MASK] balance : they continued to ease over recent weeks for nonfinancial corporations and municipalities , [MASK] they remained stable or tightened slightly for small businesses and households.3

[CLS] the earlier-than-anticipated resumption [MASK] activity has been accompanied by a sharp increase [MASK] the [MASK] spread in many [MASK] . [SEP] uncertainty will remain elevated as long as the pandemic [MASK] over the economy . [SEP] even if the virus spread flattens , the recovery is likely to [MASK] headwinds from diminished activity [MASK] costly adjustments in some sectors , along with impaired incomes [MASK] many consumers and businesses . [SEP] on top of that , rolling flare-ups or a broad second [MASK] of [MASK] virus may lead to widespread social distancing—whether mandatory [MASK] voluntary—which could weigh on the pace of [MASK] recovery [MASK] could [MASK] presage a second dip in activity . [SEP] a broad second wave could re-ignite financial market volatility and market disruptions [MASK] a time of greater vulnerability . [SEP] nonbank financial institutions could again come under pressure , as they did in march , and some banks might pull back on lending if they [MASK] rising losses or weaker capital positions . [SEP]

[CLS] a closer [MASK] [MASK] the labor market [MASK] hints at the [MASK] . [SEP] the improvement in the labor market started earlier , and has been stronger , than had been anticipated . [SEP] over [MASK] and june , payroll employment increased by 7.5 [MASK] , the unemployment rate [MASK] 3.6 percentage points , and the labor [MASK] participation rate rose [MASK] percentage points.4 the large bounceback is a sharp contrast to the global financial crisis , when [MASK] initial employment decline was [MASK] and it took much longer before a similar share of the initial job losses was recouped . [SEP]

[CLS] it [MASK] unclear whether the rapid pace of [MASK] market recovery will [MASK] sustained going [MASK] , and risks are to the downside . [SEP] the pace of improvement may slow if a [MASK] [MASK] of the easiest gains from the lifting of mandated closures and easing of capacity constraints has already occurred . [SEP] moreover , weekly covid case [MASK] have been rising , and some states [MASK] ramping up restrictions . [SEP] these developments mostly occurred after the reference period for the june employment report . [SEP] after declining at a fast clip through early june , [MASK] claims for unemployment insurance have moved roughly sideways in recent weeks and remained [MASK] a still elevated level of 1.3 million in the week ending july 4.5 some high-frequency indicators tracked by federal reserve board staff [MASK] mobility data and employment in small businesses ) suggest that the strong pace of improvement in may and [MASK] first half of june may not [MASK] sustained . [SEP]

[CLS] the pandemic's harm to lives [MASK] [MASK] is falling disproportionately on black and hispanic [MASK] . [SEP] after finally seeing welcome progress narrowing the gaps in labor market outcomes by race and ethnicity in the late stage of the previous recovery , [MASK] covid shock [MASK] inflicting a disproportionate share of [MASK] losses on african american and hispanic workers . [SEP] according to [MASK] current population [MASK] , the number of employed persons fell by 14.2 percent from february to june among african americans and by 13.4 [MASK] among hispanics—significantly worse than the 10.4 percent decline for the population [MASK]

[CLS] at the sectoral level , there is substantial heterogeneity in the effect of covid . [SEP] recent data suggest that [MASK] recoveries in sectors such as manufacturing , residential construction , and consumer goods are likely to be relatively more resilient , while consumer services are more likely to [MASK] hostage [MASK] social distancing . [SEP] manufacturing production jumped nearly 4 [MASK] in may (following a historic drop in april) , and forward-looking indicators [MASK] to another solid increase in june . [SEP] pending home sales and single-family [MASK] rose more than anticipated in may . [SEP] in [MASK] consumer sector , the rebound in [MASK] has [MASK] concentrated in [MASK] categories—especially those sold online—whereas [MASK] services categories have remained quite depressed . [SEP] a similar concern may apply to the commercial real estate (cre ) sector and to equipment investment . [SEP] [MASK] parts of the cre market—most notably , the [MASK] and retail segment—are experiencing significant distress and have seen sharp increases [MASK] delinquency rates along with tighter bank [MASK] standards . [SEP] for equipment [MASK] , production and supply chain disruptions and high levels of [MASK] continue to [MASK] on [MASK] . [SEP]

[CLS] finally , in keeping with the [MASK] nature of the pandemic , foreign developments could impinge on the u.s . [SEP] recovery . [SEP] the international monetary fund estimates that [MASK] global gross domestic product dropped at an annual [MASK] of about 18 [MASK] [MASK] the second quarter after falling nearly 13 percent in the first quarter . [SEP] while the potential [MASK] a fiscal response across the euro area is positive and important , there has [MASK] some renewal of tensions [MASK] the united states and china , and the outlook for many emerging markets remains fragile . [SEP]

[CLS] the federal reserve moved rapidly and aggressively to restore the normal functioning of markets and the [MASK] of credit to households and businesses . [SEP] the forceful response was appropriate in light [MASK] the extraordinary nature of the crisis and the importance of minimizing harm to the livelihoods of so many americans . [SEP] with the restoration of smooth market functioning and credit flows , our emergency facilities are appropriately moving into the background , providing confidence that they remain available as an insurance policy if storm clouds again move in . [SEP]

[CLS] while it is welcome news that [MASK] million jobs were added in the [MASK] two months , it is critical to stay the course in light of [MASK] remaining 14.7 million job losses that have not been restored since the covid crisis started . [SEP] the healing in the labor market is likely to take some time . [SEP] last month , a majority of federal open market committee (fomc ) participants indicated they expect economic [MASK] to decline notably [MASK] year [MASK] recover only gradually over the following two [MASK] . [SEP] a majority of fomc participants indicated that they expect core inflation to remain below our 2 percent objective and employment to fall short of its [MASK] level at [MASK] through the end of 2022 . [SEP]

[CLS] looking ahead , it will [MASK] important for monetary policy to pivot from stabilization to accommodation by supporting a full recovery in employment and returning inflation to [MASK] 2 percent objective on a sustained basis . [SEP] as we move to the next phase of monetary policy , we will be guided not only by the exigencies [MASK] the covid crisis , but also by our evolving understanding [MASK] [MASK] key longer-run [MASK] of the economy , [MASK] as to [MASK] the premature withdrawal [MASK] necessary [MASK] . [SEP] [MASK] the long-run neutral rate of interest is quite [MASK] by historical standards , there is [MASK] room to cut the policy rate in order to cushion the [MASK] from [MASK] and other shocks . [SEP] the likelihood that the policy rate is at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding expected and actual inflation , which could further compress the room to cut nominal interest rates in a downward spiral . [SEP] with [MASK] inflation running below 2 percent for many years and covid contributing [MASK] a further decline , it is [MASK] [MASK] monetary policy support inflation expectations that are consistent with inflation centered on 2 percent over time . [SEP] and with inflation [MASK] [MASK] sensitivity to [MASK] market tightness , policy should not [MASK] withdraw support based [MASK] a historically steeper phillips curve that is not [MASK] in evidence . [SEP] instead , policy should seek to achieve employment outcomes with the [MASK] of breadth and depth [MASK] [MASK] only achieved [MASK] in the previous recovery.11

[CLS] with the policy rate constrained by the effective [MASK] [MASK] , forward guidance constitutes a vital way to provide [MASK] necessary [MASK] . [SEP] for instance , research suggests that refraining from liftoff until inflation reaches 2 percent could lead to some modest temporary overshooting , which would help offset [MASK] previous underperformance.12 balance sheet policies can help extend accommodation by more directly influencing the interest rates that [MASK] relevant for household and business borrowing and investment .
